NAME
	cow - launches a Cow instance.

SYNOPSIS
	cow -h
	cow -g <gameName> [-a aiName ...] [-r replayName ...]
				[-s speed] [-t] [-x] [-z gameParameter ...]
	cow -g gameName -p replayName [-s speed] [-x] 

DESCRIPTION
	Launches a Cow instance playing a game with the specified AIs.
	Possible arguments are listed below:

-a, --ai aiName ...
	Adds one or more AIs, named aiName. This option can be used several times
	to add more AIs. Each AI will be given an unique ID according to its
	position in the arguments list, starting with ID 1, with an increment of 1.
	A game can be played without any AI specified.

-g, --game gameName
	Specifies the game to be played. It must be specified or otherwise the game
	or replay cannot be played.

-h, --help
	Displays this man page, ignoring every other option if any are specified.

-n, --noview
	Plays the game without a GUI and the game view.
	Note: this option enables the -x option (starts automatically the game).

-p, --load replayFile
	Plays the replay from the given file. This replay must be in the
	gameName/replays directory.

-q, --quiet
	Plays quielty and don't log anything except match result and errors.

-r, --save replayFile ...
	Saves the future game into a replay file named replayFile, stored under
	the gameName/replays directory.
	Several replays can be saved by using this option multiple times.

-s, --speed speed
	Defines the initial speed of the game as speed, in frames per seconds,
	between 1 and 1000 fps included (default is 5fps).
	If speed is set to "unlimited" or "u", the game will go as fast as it
	can go. If the speed is defined more than once, only the last definition
	will prevail.

-t, --test
	Starts the platform in test mode, making everything run into the same
	process, thus accelerating the game speed.

-x, --auto
	If set, starts automatically the game when the view is ready.

-z, --parameters gameParameter ...
	Specifies multiple parameters to be read by the game. This option should
	be the last one because every other parameter after this option will be
	a game parameter and won't be used by the platform.

EXAMPLES
cow -g TestGame -a MyAI -a OpponentAI
	Starts the game "TestGame" with two AIs, "MyAI" and "OpponentAI".
	
cow -g TestGame -a MyAI -a OpponentAI -s 60 -r "game #1"
	Starts the game "TestGame" with two AIs, "MyAI" and "OpponentAI", at a
	speed of 60fps, and saving the game in a replay file named "game #1".
	
cow -g TestGame -p "game #1"
	Replays a game of "TestGame" saved in the file "game #1".
